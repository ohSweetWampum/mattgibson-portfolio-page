## Description

Portfolio pages are essential for web developers, as this pages show case the skills the individual has via the projects they have made. I wanted to make a portfolio page for this reason. In the webpage I provided my contact info, projects I've done so far and a little bit about me.

## Usage

## Learning Points

Main things I learned were:
